# Sea-cucumber-gonads

This repository was created to upload the data that support the findings of the paper "Sex-specific seasonal variations in the fatty acid and carotenoid composition of sea cucumber gonads and implications for aquaculture" by David et al. (2022).

It consists of two tables (fatty acid composition of gonads and carotenoid composition of gonads).

The first columns are commun to both tables although the sample list is longer in the carotenoid table.

- Id refers to an individual identifier for the sea cucumber in the form GO_FXX_GLXX where GO stands for gonad, F (or M) for sex, XX for the number of individual in the batch GLXX.
- splMass refers to the weight of gonad that was used to conduct the analysis.
- StdC23 (only in the fatty acid table) refers to the amount of C23 standard added to the sample (in ug).
- Gonadwt refers to the fesh weight of the full gonad after dissection
- Idweight refers to the fresh eviscerated weight of the individual after dissection
- splDate refers to the date where the samples were collected

- Fatty acids are reported as the area of the FID signal correponding to each fatty acid. Fatty acid are annotated in the form Ca.bwc where a refers to the number of carbons, b to the number of double bounds and c to the position of the first double bound from the end of chain.
- Pigments are reported as absolute concentrations in mg per g of dry gonad
